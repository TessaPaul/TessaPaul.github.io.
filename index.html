 <h2 class="facts">Rainbow Lorikeet Facts</h2>
 <p class="story">Appearance
The rainbow lorikeet measures between 25-30cm (9.8-11.8in) from the head to the tip of it’s tail. Their wing span is 17cm (6.7in) and they weigh between 75 and 157g (2.6-5.5oz). 
They have very bright colouring which includes an orange beak, a blue head with green on the back and the chest is a reddy-orange with black bars and it has green wings and tail feathers. Baby lorikeets have a black beak instead of an orange one which changes colour as they grow older. 
Diet
Rainbow lorikeet’s primarily feed on nectar and pollen which they gather from shrubs and trees. To supplement this they also eat fruits, seeds and the occasional insect. They regularly frequent bird feeders to get food and will also accept food out of a humans hand. <br>
<br>
Some zoos allow people to feed their lorikeets with specially prepared mixes.<br>
<br>
Range
Their natural range is Australia, Eastern Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, New Caledonia, the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu. In Australia they are found in the states of South Australia, New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland and the Northern Territory.
Rainbow lorikeets have also been introduced to Hong Kong, Perth, Tasmania and Auckland. <br>

Habitat
Rainbow lorikeets live in rainforests, coastal areas and woodlands and can now also be found in many built up area’s due to habitat loss.
Reproduction
In Australia rainbow lorikeets breed from June to January. Males and females mate for life.
Both sexes work together to create the nest. This is typically located in a tree hollow. They will line the nest with chewed or decayed wood. 
The female lays between 1-3 eggs which are incubated by the female for about 25 days. These remain in the nest and are cared for, for 45 days.
Sexual maturity is achieved at 2 years old. 
Behavior
The rainbow lorikeet makes a range of screeching and chattering noises to communicate with one another.
For the most part they remain in one area. They may complete some nomadic movements to take advantage of the seasonal flowering and fruiting of plants. 
Rainbow lorikeets travel in flocks of one or two dozen.
They may travel up to 64km (40miles) a day to find food. <br>
<br>

Predators and Threats
The main predator of the rainbow lorikeet is predatory birds
Rainbow lorikeet populations are decreasing. Some of this is caused by human interference. These birds are regularly fed in backyards and this can lead to them becoming ill as people give them the wrong foods.
They are also affected by Psittacine beak and feather disease, this is an infectious disease which breaks down keratin in the body and is affecting many of Australia's birds.
Quick facts
The rainbow lorikeet can learn to say many words.
They are regularly kept as pets.

  <p><h2 class="facts">10 FASCINATING FACTS ABOUT BUTTERFLIES</h2></p>
 <p class="story">Who doesn’t enjoy witnessing one of these winged beauties in flight? From their brightly colored bodies to the effortless motion that seems in sync with some unheard symphony, butterflies are an insect each of us can appreciate. But how much do we know about them? This list includes 10 cool facts that are sure to make you think about butterflies in a whole new way.

Transparent Butterfly wings
1. Butterfly wings are transparent. Before you feel the need to schedule an eye exam, let us explain. The wings of a butterfly are covered in a multitude of miniature scales  –thousands of them. And those colors you see when a butterfly flits across your yard are the reflection of various colors through the scales. The wings themselves are made up of a protein called chitin, which is the same protein that forms an insect’s exoskeleton. And much like an exoskeleton, chitin is transparent. You’ve learned something new already!

2. There are almost 20,000 butterfly species. If you’d ever considered memorizing all the various species of butterflies, it may take longer than you were anticipating. An easier starting point would be those species regularly occurring in the lower 48 states of the US. Still, that number is right around 575, so we’re recommending note cards or, perhaps, focusing on the butterflies you find in and around your yard this spring and summer.

3. Butterflies use their feet to taste.If everything up until this point was already a part of your existing butterfly knowledge, this fact may come as a curveball. However, if you think about it from the butterfly’s point of view, it isn’t that unusual. A butterfly’s daily activities consist of eating and mating, both of which require landing – even if it is only briefly. When food is the priority, those taste receptors help the butterfly locate the right plants and the key nutrients it needs for survival. Although many people wonder what it means when a butterfly lands on them, the truth is that it’s probably just hungry.

4. Butterflies only live for a few weeks.For everyone who has been anxiously awaiting this since our earlier reference, or who simply skipped ahead until they found it, here you go. The average lifespan of an adult butterfly is roughly three to four weeks, however, the entire life cycle can last anywhere between two and eight months. As with anything, there are exceptions to the rule. At least one species of butterfly lives for approximately 24 hours, while some migratory butterflies, like the North American Monarch, can survive for nearly eight months. 

5. The most common butterfly in the US is the Cabbage White.
Named for its mostly white marking, when hints of yellow and green like the vegetable, the Cabbage White may not be the most colorful butterfly in your garden or yard, but it is the most common. The male Cabbage White has one prominent black spot on each wing, while the female has two.
6. Some butterfly species migrate from the cold.
Although in many cases cold weather will end the already short life of a butterfly by rendering them immobile, others take the dropping temperature as a signal to move. Butterflies are cold-blooded and require – in ideal settings – a body temperature of approximately 85 degrees to activate their flight muscles. If the weather begins changing some species simply migrate in search of sunshine. Some, like the North American Monarch, travel an average of 2,500 miles!
7. One of the largest butterflies is the Giant Swallowtail Butterfly.
With a wingspread of between four and seven inches, this species has a name that fits its dimensions. If you have ever seen one on a hike or around your yard, you may have been spellbound by the sight of it. Their swallowtail description is borrowed from birds of the same name, thanks to the long tails on this butterfly’s hindwings.
8. Butterflies have a liquid diet.We mentioned earlier that butterflies like to eat, which is true. What we didn’t include at the time is that their source of food is exclusively liquid. In fact, they simply don’t have the necessary apparatus for chewing. Using their proboscis, which functions in the same way you or I might use a straw, butterflies drink nectar or some other variation of liquid sustenance. 

9. Butterfly wings help them against predators.
As we’ve discussed, the lifespan of the average butterfly is short, and even at their peak, these insects are some of the most fragile. Staying alive for as long as possible allows the butterfly additional opportunities to mate, and continuing the existence of its species is of utmost importance. Therefore, butterflies frequently use their wings as a defense mechanism. Either by folding to blend in with their surroundings, or wearing a full spectrum of colors and patterns to frighten predators, a butterfly’s wings are often their best protection. 
10. Butterflies actually have four wings, not two.Speaking of wings, we may have intentionally left the most fascinating butterfly fact until last! Despite how they may appear in motion, or in drawings or paintings you may have seen, butterflies have four separate wings. The wings closest to its head are called the forewings, while those in the rear are called the hindwings. Thanks to strong muscles in the butterfly’s thorax, all four wings move up and down in a figure-eight pattern during flight.<br>

  <p class="story"> And to move on I can show you the next part <strong>THE WILD ANIMALS!!!.</strong> 
     So first I will show a kind of common animal in any zoo.   
    <img src="https://cdn.kastatic.org/third_party/javascript-khansrc/live-editor/build/images/animals/cheetah.png" width="600">
 <em>This was an awesome cheetah.</em>And it was well trained.At first when we reached there I was really scared and frightened looking at its body and stuf. Then we understood that it was well trained because because it came close and we tried touching it though it was the told to be the dumpest thing one could do , but seemed that it was the other way around it didn't bite or do any thing like that instead it let us touch it and that was the best moment of my life😍🥰.  </p>
    <p><h2 class="facts">Amazing Facts About the Cheetah</h2><p></p>
  <p class="story">    Built for speed, cheetahs are slender, with long thin legs and a long tail. They have coarse, short fur that is yellowish tan in colour and covered in solid black spots. Black tear-shaped streaks on the face help to reflect the sun when hunting. Adults weigh around 46–158 lb (21–72 kg).<br>
<strong> How many spots do cheetahs have?</strong><br>
Cheetahs have between 2,000 and 3,000 spots, which help them to camouflage themselves.
<br>
<strong>Where do cheetahs live?</strong><br>
Previously, cheetahs were wide-spread across African and Asian continents, but now they are confined mostly to dry open grasslands of Sub-Saharan Africa, with the majority inhabiting natural reserves or parks.
<br>
What do cheetahs eat?
Cheetahs are carnivores, so rely on meat for survival. Their diet is made up primarily of smaller antelopes including springbok, steenbok, Thomson’s gazelle, impalas, and duiker. Cheetahs will also feed on wildebeest calves and, occasionally, smaller animals including rabbits, hares and birds.
<br>
How often do cheetahs drink?
Cheetahs have evolved to live in an environment where water is scarce, and can survive on one drink every three to four days.
Are cheetahs solitary?
Female cheetahs are solitary, living alone or with their young. Males however, live in small family groups of 2–3 brothers, known as coalitions.
<br>
How fast can cheetahs run?
The cheetah is the fastest land animal in the world, reaching speeds of up to 70 miles per hour. They can accelerate from 0 to 68 miles per hour in just three seconds. Cheetahs are the only big cat that can turn in mid-air while sprinting.
<br>
How does the cheetahs tail help when running?
Cheetahs long muscular tails have a flat shape that is used for balance and steering. The tail essentially acts like a rudder on a boat.
<br>
Where do cheetahs give birth?
Cheetahs start reproducing at a young age; males at the age of one and females at two. There is no specific breeding season and cheetahs will mate with many individuals throughout their lifetimes.
<br>
Male cheetahs do not remain with the females after mating, and do not play any role in rearing young. Female cheetahs on the other hand are caring, affectionate and dedicated mothers. Following a pregnancy of three months, female cheetahs will give birth to a litter of 2–8 cubs in a secluded spot such as a rocky outcrop or marshy area with tall grass.
<br>
Cubs are vulnerable to predators, and many do not survive the first year. Initially, mothers leave the cubs hidden whilst hunting, but cubs will start accompanying her at around six weeks.
<br>
How long do cubs stay with their mothers?
Female cheetahs spend a long time caring for their cubs and teaching them essential survival skills like hunting. Cubs typically stay with their mothers for one and a half to two years.
<br>
What is the biggest threat to cheetahs?
Cheetahs are classified as vulnerable by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. With around 10,000–12,000 individuals left in the wild, cheetahs are Africa’s most endangered big cat.
<br>
Historically, cheetahs have been hunted for their fur, but today some of the biggest threats to their survival are loss of habitat, and competition for resources. Cheetahs require large areas of land for survival, so increased human settlements and road construction in their habitat puts them at risk.<br>

 Lets go to the next one a very unusall dog like thing <img src="https://cdn.kastatic.org/third_party/javascript-khansrc/live-editor/build/images/animals/dogs_collies.png" width="600">  
    This is a weird dog called "<em>Dog collies</em>" and they were really good you know like yea so it was great.<br>
<h2 class="facts">10 Things You Didn’t Know About the Border Collie</h2><br>
 <br></p>
<p class="story">If you’re searching for a dog breed that brings together compelling beauty, a fantastic work ethic, and innate intelligence that shines from bright eyes, the Collie is a superior choice. From their long, elegant muzzles to their surprisingly light and nimble step, these herding dogs are a wonderful family pet for all types of households. Their mild nature makes them suitable for nearly any environment, and their patient, trainable behavior makes them adept at everything from canine companionship to acting as a loyal guard dog. There’s a lot to explore with this beloved breed, however – and there’s no better way to start learning than with these 10 fun facts about Collie dogs:<br>
<br>
1)      Collies and Border Collies are different breeds: While they both have “Collie” in their name and share some characteristics, Collies and Border Collies are visually distinct. A Border Collie looks similar to a smooth-coated Standard Collie but is more streamlined and generally smaller. The breed name comes from their location of origin – the border between Scotland and England. The name “Collie” itself is thought by some to be a nod to the dogs’ original coal-black coat, filtered through the brogue of a Gaelic accent: coaly.<br>
<br>
2)      Their tail position has a distinct purpose: When in “working mode,” the Collie’s tail hangs down between their back legs, although untucked. This keeps it out of the way of wayward hooves, should their livestock charges get a little feisty. Once the herd has been gathered and it’s time to head in, however, the tail will go up as the dog guides both human master and animal flock back home safe. One of the more interesting Collie fun facts has to do with the tip of their tail. The flare of white found at the end of both Standard and Border Collies’ tails has a special nickname: the Shepherd’s Lantern, as the bright white hue makes it easy to spot in low-light conditions.<br>
<br>
3)      Border Collies excel at agility: All the instinctual moves required by these high-energy herding dogs translate very well to competition and stage alike. The American Kennel Club (AKC) notes that Border Collies frequently make it to the top of the leaderboards in formal agility competitions. The same breed has a loyal fan following as well, thanks to crowd-pleasing performances on major entertainment shows like America’s Got Talent. Able to “dance” on their hind paws by jumping with proper training, these pups can also weave in and out of their handler’s feet with amazing dexterity, both forwards and backward. Just like other herding breeds, you can train a Collie quite easily, as long as their humans are diligent with practices.<br>
<br>
4)      The Standard Collie has two coat variations: The most well-known coat variant of the Standard Collie is the “rough” coat, which isn’t rough so much as it is voluminous. This puffy double-coat needs diligent grooming to stay looking healthy and beautiful, and is also the source of substantial shedding during the dog’s annual or twice-yearly “coat blow.” Keep in mind that Collies are not hypogenic dogs. Their shedding may pose an issue to individuals who are sensitive to pet dander. A Standard Collie with a smooth coat is short-haired by contrast, with slightly less shedding to contend with. The smooth coat’s lack of volume gives the dog a very different silhouette compared to that of the rough coat: when seeing one for the first time, it’s easy to understand how they’re mistaken for Border Collies.<br>
<br>
5)      There are 4 recognized coat colors in the Standard Collie: The AKC lists the accepted and recognized colors like white, tri-color (white, brown, and black), sable and white (brown and white), and blue merle (mottled blue-grey, black, and white). The latter is the coloring gene trait that gives some Standard and Border Collies their bright blue or unusual (e.g. differently-colored) eyes, as well as beautiful multi-color coats. The mottled merle pattern isn’t judged any differently from a professional perspective, but it is prized as an aesthetic by Collie owners with pups that share the characteristic coat. While it might seem like a good idea to breed merled coat dogs together, this has a chance of introducing eye and ear abnormalities in Border Collie puppies: the merle gene is closely linked to the development genes of the eyes and ears. This is why most breeders will only breed a merle with a non-merle coated Collie out of caution and concern for the health of the offspring.<br>
<br>
6)      While generally well-mannered, Collies aren’t silent: Because many, even most, Collie owners take the time to train and work with their dogs, an out-of-control Collie isn’t a familiar sight. In fact, the Standard Collie’s mild nature and personality traits have led some prospective owners to wonder if, like the Basenji breed, Collies don’t bark. They do in fact bark and are prone to doing so if they are bored, crated for an excessive period of time, or left to their own devices while pet parents are off to work. Potential Collie owners should not mistake a calm momentary demeanor for a trait that will last a lifetime. Providing these dogs with plenty of toys and engagement is the key to saving your furniture, giving your family peace and quiet, and establishing a bond with your Collie.<br>
<br>
7)      Border Collies are physiologically shaped for herding: Beyond a general affinity to rounding up animals, Border Collies actually have a skeletal structure that supports their signature move: the crouch. A space between their shoulder blades allows these dogs to comfortably lower their torso to the ground while keeping their hindquarters at a standing position, moving all the while. This move gets them closer to the heels and hooves of the animals they’re trained to herd, allowing them to nip and guide the pack with precision and a clear view. Combined with their dynamic tail positions and expressive ears, watching the body movements of a Collie at work is truly a sight to behold. Whether these dogs are herd sheep or not, they should constantly receive physical and mental stimulation to stay happy and healthy.<br>
<br>
8)      Intense staring is part of the package: Anyone who has owned a dog knows that chowing down on a particularly delicious snack is bound to get you a lot of canine attention. Border Collies, however, take this move to the next level. An intense, eye-locking gaze from your beloved pet can feel a little unnerving – particularly when you recall that domestic dogs descended from wolves. Not to worry, however, if your Border Collie is giving you “the eye”, they’re just demonstrating one of their most skillful herding tricks. Livestock is, by and large, prey animals. This intense stare mimics predatory behavior, triggering the pack to go in the direction the dog wants them to.<br>
<br>
9)      They aren’t exactly contenders for the most independent dog: Because the breed was created to be a working dog, everything in their genetics is keyed to stick close to their human companion. An energetic working dog like a Collie needs physical and mental stimulation for their own well-being, not to mention access to frequent exercise. Remember, this breed is built to run across wide fields and plains, staying out all day to manage and watch after the herd – lazy napping in front of the TV isn’t likely to appeal, particularly to younger Border Collie puppies. Be prepared for loud barking and potentially destructive boredom-based behaviors if you routinely leave a Collie alone all day.<br>
<br>
10)The Border Collie family tree starts with a substantial trunk: Some dog breeds are a bit of a mystery, with only oral history and genetic research to guide investigative dives. Today’s Border Collies all – or, at least, mostly all – share a common ancestor: Old Hemp. Born in 1893, he fathered a staggering 200 documented pups over the course of his studying lifetime, all of which carried an enviable genetic predisposition. Old Hemp was known for his quiet and relatively non-aggressive herding technique, a benefit that owners looking for an excellent herding dog clamored for. A later 1901 addition to the breed’s genetics, Old Kemp, was thought to have added a pleasant human-friendly disposition and the breed’s notorious intense gaze-as-herding-technique.<br>

   <img src="https://cdn.kastatic.org/third_party/javascript-khansrc/live-editor/build/images/animals/fox.png" width="600"> 
   So, this is common it is called a fox and I guess it is there in every zoo.And when I saw it I was like <em>"Ohh here we see the clever animal which finds out other animals tricks" and then I told "and it makes tricks which no other animal can guess".</em>    <h2 class="facts">25 Fascinating Facts About Foxes</h2></p>
    
<p class="story">Foxes live on every continent except Antarctica and thrive in cities, towns, and rural settings. Despite being all around us, they're a bit of a mystery. Here's more about this elusive animal. <br>
<br>
1. FOXES ARE RELATED TO DOGS.<br>
Foxes are members of the Canidae family, which means they're related to wolves, jackals, and dogs. They're medium-sized, weighing anywhere between 2 and 24 pounds, with pointy faces, lithe frames, and bushy tails.<br>
<br>
2. FOXES ARE SOLITARY.<br>
Unlike their relatives, foxes are not pack animals. When raising their young, they live in small families—called a “leash of foxes” or a “skulk of foxes”—in underground burrows. Otherwise, they hunt and sleep alone.<br>
<br>
3. FOXES HAVE A LOT IN COMMON WITH CATS.<br>
<br>
A gray fox in a tree.
Like a cat, the fox is most active after the sun goes down. It has vertically oriented pupils so it can see in dim light, and it hunts by stalking and pouncing on its prey. The fox also has sensitive cat-like whiskers and spines on its tongue. It walks on its toes, which accounts for its elegant, feline-like tread. The gray fox even has semi-retractable claws, making it the only member of the dog family that climbs trees. It has been known to sleep in the branches—just like a cat.<br>
<br>
4. THERE ARE 12 TRUE FOXES—AND MANY RELATIVES.<br>
Although there are 37 animals called foxes, only 12 are considered “true foxes,” meaning they're from the genus Vulpes. Some of these include the red, Arctic, fennec, and kit foxes. True foxes have flattened skulls, triangular snouts, and fluffy tails, but it's common to be confused when seeing one in real life. Research found that while nature lovers can identify most North American mammals, they frequently mix foxes up with other canids, like coyotes.<br>
<br>
5. THE RED FOX IS THE MOST COMMON FOX.<br>
Geographically, the red fox has the widest range of any of the 280 animals in the order Carnivora. While its natural habitat is a mixed landscape of scrub and woodland, its flexible diet allows it to adapt to many environments. As a result, its range is the entire Northern Hemisphere, from the Arctic Circle to North Africa to Central America to the Asiatic steppes. It's even in Australia, where it's considered an invasive species.<br>
<br>
6. FOXES USE THE EARTH’S MAGNETIC FIELD.<br>
<br>
Foxes are adept hunters.
Like a guided missile, the fox harnesses the Earth's magnetic field to hunt. Other animals, like birds, sharks, and turtles, have this “magnetic sense,” but the fox is the first one we've discovered that uses it to catch prey.<br>
<br>
According to New Scientist, the fox can see the earth's magnetic field as a “ring of shadow” on its eyes that darkens as it moves toward magnetic north. When the shadow and the sound of prey lines up, it's time to pounce. Check out this video to see a fox in action.<br>
<br>
7. FOXES ARE GOOD PARENTS.<br>
Fox pups are born blind and don't open their eyes until nine days after birth. During that time, they stay with the vixen (female) in the den while the dog (male) brings them food. They live with their parents until they're 7 months old. Vixens sometimes go to great lengths to protect their pups—once, in England, a fox pup was caught in a wire trap for two weeks but survived because its mother brought it food every day.<br>
<br>
8. FOX PUP PLAY CAN GET VIOLENT.<br>
Foxes are known to play among themselves, as well as with other animals. But play also establishes social hierarchy, and it starts very young. Animal behaviorist Sandra Alvarez-Betancourt studied thousands of hours of footage taken with an infrared camera of pup activity in the den. She discovered that the struggle for dominance starts as soon as the pups can walk. The play can be brutal—and even fatal. One in five pups never make it out of the den.<br>
<br>
9. THE SMALLEST FOX WEIGHS LESS THAN 3 POUNDS.<br>
<br>
The Fennec fox is a small but mighty predator.
Roughly the size of a kitten, the fennec fox has elongated ears and a creamy coat. It lives in North African deserts, where it sleeps during the day to avoid the searing heat. The long ears not only allow it to hear prey, they also radiate body heat to keep the fox cool. Its paws are covered with fur so that the fox can walk on hot sand, like it's wearing snowshoes.<br>
<br>
10. FOXES HAVE LONG HAD A RELATIONSHIP WITH HUMANS.<br>
Although foxes are usually wild, their relationship with people goes way back. In 2011, researchers opened a grave in a 16,500-year-old Jordan cemetery to find the remains of a man and his pet fox. This was 4000 years before the first-known human and domestic dog were buried together.<br>
<br>
11. THE ISLAND FOX IS AN EVOLUTIONARY PUZZLE.<br>
This small fox lives on the Channel Islands off the coast of Southern California. It's thought to be a descendant of gray foxes brought over by the people who settled the islands 13,000 years ago. Recent studies show that island foxes are genetically identical to each other. One group “set a record for the least genetic variation in a sexually reproducing species,” according to The New York Times. Normally that's bad news, since lack of genetic diversity leads to disease and deformity, but the island fox has proven resilient. While at one point they were critically endangered, they've responded to conservation efforts and have been upgraded in status to near threatened.<br>
<br>
12. FOX FUR COMES IN MANY COLORS.<br>
<br>
A cross fox.
For instance, the Arctic fox is either a blue morph or a white morph, which changes colors with the seasons. The white morph is brown or gray in summer and turns white when there's snow on the ground. The blue morph is dark gray or brown all year long.<br>
<br>
The red fox also comes in many colors, including silver, black, orange, or a mix of all three. While color variations happen naturally, people have bred foxes for fur, leading to many different patterns. These include the marble fox, which is white with gray or black streaks; the cross fox, which is red with back patches; and the pink champagne fox, which has peachy-white fur and a pink nose.<br>
<br>
13. THE TAMER FOXES GET, THE MORE THEY’RE LIKE DOGS.<br>
In 1959, a Soviet geneticist named Dmitry Belyaev conducted an experiment in domestication. He selectively bred silver foxes, picking only the ones that showed the least aggression toward humans. Within 10 generations, the foxes started seeking people out, licking hands, barking, and wagging their tails. White spots appeared on their coats and they developed floppy ears. It suggested genetic links between how domesticated animals look and act. While the experiment's methodology has been challenged, the study gave insight into how selective breeding affects domestication.<br>
<br>
14. SOME PEOPLE KEEP FOXES AS PETS.<br>
Although wild animals should never be pets, thanks to Belyaev's experiment, domesticated foxes do exist. Unlike a tame fox, which has learned to tolerate humans, a domesticated fox is bred to be docile from birth. Laws for and access to pet foxes vary by location. They're reportedly curious and sweet-tempered, but also high-energy and tend to get into everything. Some liken it to living with a 2-year-old. (Note that unlike the foxes from the Siberian facility, foxes bred within the U.S. are not actually domesticated or tame).<br>

15. SWITZERLAND TRICKED FOXES INTO VACCINATING THEMSELVES.<br>
<br>
Foxes can have a little rabies vaccine, as a treat.
In the 1960s, there was a rabies epidemic among foxes in Switzerland. Since rabies can be transferred to humans through an animal bite, and is often fatal, it was a public health crisis. The government wanted to vaccinate foxes against rabies, but administering the doses by hand proved difficult and expensive. Instead, they started dropping vaccinated chicken heads on the countryside for the foxes to eat—52,000 in all. “From 1979 to 1984, chicken heads would rain down on the countryside,” according to The Atlantic. It worked. Rabies disappeared, a testimony to the effectiveness of vaccines, and to the foxes' love of chicken.<br>
<br>
16. ARCTIC FOXES DON’T SHIVER UNTIL -94°F (-70°C).
The Arctic fox, which lives in the northernmost parts of the hemisphere, can handle cold better than most animals on Earth. It doesn't shiver until -94° F (-70° C). Not only does the fox's thick fur hold in heat, it wraps its tail around its body like a blanket to keep warm. In autumn, the fox builds up fat, sometimes increasing its body weight by half. This adds insulation and helps the fox survive the coldest days of winter, when food is scarce.<br>
<br>
17. CLIMATE CHANGE IS HURTING ARCTIC FOXES.<br>
<br>

The number of Arctic foxes is declining, and the reason may be the red fox. As temperatures increase, the red fox is moving into the Arctic tundra and competing for prey. Red foxes are superior hunters and, to make matters worse, they also eat Arctic foxes. None of this bodes well for the Arctic fox's future.<br>
<br>
18. FOX HUNTS CONTINUE TO BE CONTROVERSIAL.<br>
Since the 16th century, fox hunting has been a popular activity in Britain. In the 19th century, the upper classes turned fox hunting into a formalized sport, where a pack of hounds and men on horseback chase a fox until it's killed. Today, whether to ban fox hunting continues to be a controversial subject in the UK, where many people see foxes as pests. Currently, fox hunting is allowed with two dogs if the fox is damaging your property.<br>
<br>
19. FOXES ARE FAST.<br>
Some foxes can run up to 42 mph, giving new meaning to the phrase “quick like a fox.” They're also agile. They can jump three feet in the air and climb fences and over roofs. They also have impressive endurance: One Arctic fox walked 2700 miles, from Norway to Canada, in three months. That's over 30 miles a day.<br>
<br>
20. FOXES APPEAR THROUGHOUT FOLKLORE.<br>
<br>
Reynard the Fox as depicted in an 1869 children's book.
Examples include the nine-tail fox from various Asian cultures; the Reynard tales from medieval Europe; the sly trickster fox from Native American lore; and Aesop's “The Fox and the Crow.” The Finnish believed a fox made the Northern Lights by running in the snow so that its tail swept sparks into the sky. From this, we get the phrase “fox fires” (though “Firefox,” like the Mozilla internet browser, refers to the red panda).<br>
<br>
21. FOXES ARE ASSOCIATED WITH BEING SNEAKY.<br>
In Western culture, foxes have long been called wily, clever, and cunning. This isn't a compliment, however, as these foxes were portrayed as deceptive tricksters only out for themselves. This attitude may reflect the fox's adaptability, nocturnal habits, and tenacious ability to get into a hen house or evade hunting dogs. Certainly foxes still outwit humans on a regular basis. In one video, an Arctic fox appears to play dead to escape Siberian fur trappers—proving itself to be one sly fox.<br>
<br>
22. IN LONDON, FOXES ARE DOMESTICATING THEMSELVES.<br>
A study looking at urban foxes in London revealed something surprising: They are starting to look more like domesticated dogs. Compared to their rural relatives, London foxes have shorter snouts and smaller brains. While it's unclear why this is, the strange part is that the foxes are doing this to themselves. As evolutionary biologist Kevin Parsons explained to the BBC, “This is the result of foxes that have decided to live near people, showing these traits that make them look more like domesticated animals.”<br>
<br>
23. BAT-EARED FOXES LISTEN FOR INSECTS.<br>
<br>
A bat-eared fox.
The bat-eared fox is aptly named, not just because of its 5-inch ears, but because of what it uses those ears for—like the bat, it listens for insects. On a typical night, it walks along the African savannah, listening for prey digging underground. Although the fox eats a variety of insects and lizards, most of its diet is made up of termites. In fact, the bat-eared fox often makes its home in termite mounds, which it usually cleans out of inhabitants before moving in.<br>
<br>
24. CHARLES DARWIN DISCOVERED A FOX SPECIES.<br>
During his voyage on the Beagle, Charles Darwin discovered a small fox on Chiloé Island off the coast of Chile. The fox was sitting on a rocky cliff gazing curiously at the ship anchored offshore. Darwin wrote, “He was so intently absorbed in watching the work of the officers, that I was able, by quietly walking up behind, to knock him on the head with my geological hammer.”<br>
<br>
Today, this small gray fox is critically endangered and lives in two spots in the world: On the Island of Chiloé and the mainland of Chile near a national park. The fox's greatest threats are habitat loss and rabid dogs.<br>
<br>
25. WHAT DOES THE FOX SAY? A LOT, ACTUALLY.<br>
Foxes make 40 different sounds, some of which you can listen to here. The most startling, though, might be its scream.<br>

 <h2 class="facts">15 Fun Facts About Kangaroos</h2></p>
 <p class="story">Kangaroos are an icon of Australia! These adorable hoppy creatures make up for a large amount of Australia’s animal population.<br>
<br>
There’s a lot that people don’t know about kangaroos, so we put together the best 15 facts about kangaroos!<br>
<br>
KANGAROOS DON'T EMIT MUCH METHANE.<br>
A kangaroo jumping across a sandy road
Scientists have identified a special type of bacterium in the stomachs of kangaroos that process their food without producing methane.<br>
<br>
This result is not only good for the environment, but it’s more efficient for the kangaroos to process their food.<br>
<br>
Researchers hope to study these bacteria to try to implement it in farm animals, like cows, in order to reduce the amount of methane harming the environment.<br>
<br>
KANGAROOS CAN FLEX.<br>
Kangaroos Flex to Impress
It’s not just human guys that flex to impress the ladies, male kangaroos do it too!<br>
<br>
Male kangaroos use their arms to fend off rival mates.<br>
<br>
The kangaroos with larger biceps and showed them off were more often chosen by the female kangaroos.<br>
<br>
IF KANGAROOS ARE CHASED, THEY RUN TO WATER.<br>

Although kangaroos don’t have many predators, they can sometimes be attacked by humans or dingoes.<br>
<br>
As a defense, kangaroos often lead the pursuer into water. Once there, the kangaroo will try to drown the attacker.<br>
<br>
Otherwise, the kangaroo will back against a tree and kick – this has enough force to kill a human.<br>
<br>
KANGAROOS HOP BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO.<br>
Two Kangaroos Hopping
You always see kangaroos hopping around because they can’t move their legs independently.<br>
<br>
The structure of their legs renders them incapable of using them to walk.<br>
<br>
Fortunately, it seems they really wouldn’t need to, seeing as they can hop at speeds of over 35 miles per hour!<br>
<br>
FEMALE KANGAROOS CAN PAUSE A PREGNANCY.<br>
A pregnant kangaroo
The reason the kangaroo population is so high, is because female kangaroos are pretty much constantly pregnant.<br>
<br>
After a newborn joey reaches the pouch, the female will get pregnant again.<br>
<br>
However, she can freeze the embryo development until the current joey is able to leave the pouch!<br>
<br>
Once it leaves, she resumes her pregnancy and the cycle repeats.<br>
<br>
MOST KANGAROOS ARE LEFT-HANDED.<br>
Left Handed Kangaroo
While it’s often thought that humans are the only species that have a dominant hand, kangaroos do as well!<br>
<br>
Wild kangaroos gravitate to using their left hands for tasks like grooming and feeding.<br>
<br>
AUSTRALIA HAS MORE KANGAROOS THAN HUMANS.<br>
A group of kangaroos on a field
In comparison to the 24 million people living in Australia, there are 44 million kangaroos as of 2015.<br>
<br>
That’s quite a leap from 2009 when there were only 27 million kangaroos!<br>
<br>
The overpopulation of kangaroos leads to our next fact.<br>
<br>
KANGAROO MEAT IS COMMON TO AUSTRALIANS.<br>
Kangaroo steaks and chunky French fries
It’s not unusual to find a “kangaroo burger” on a menu in Australia!<br>
<br>
In fact, it is a healthier option as it is high in protein and low in fat, as well as a more sustainable alternative to other meat.<br>
<br>
Because the kangaroo population is so high, it’s not a threat to their existence.<br>
<br>
KANGAROOS ARE HIT BY CARS ALL THE TIME.<br>
A car driving down a highway with a sign to warn drivers about kangaroos in the area
In fact, 80% of animals hit by cars in Australia are kangaroos.<br>
<br>
The majority of rental car insurance policies don’t cover you if you drive in the Outback when it’s dark because the chances of hitting a kangaroo are so high.<br>
<br>
Many people who live in the country have metal “roo” bars to decrease the impacts of hitting a kangaroo.<br>
<br>
THERE'S SPECIES OF KANGAROOS THAT LIVE ON TREES.<br>
Tree Kangaroo
If you saw these kangaroos, you wouldn’t think they were kangaroos! Unlike the kangaroos we think of, tree kangaroos walk on all fours and don’t hop.<br>
<br>
Not only that, but they’re native to New Guinea, and only far northeastern Queensland, unlike the majority of kangaroos that are native to Australia in general.<br>
<br>
Sadly, this rare species’ population is on the decline due to deforestation and hunting.<br>
<br>
THE TAILS OF KANGAROOS ACT LIKE A THRID LEG.<br>

Not only do kangaroos use their tail for balance, but it’s also like an extra leg.<br>
<br>
They have a unique “walk” in which they push off the ground with their tail followed by jumping with their legs.<br>
<br>
The force of their tail is the equivalent power as their legs combined.<br>
<br>
KANGAROOS DON'T SWEAT.<br>

Since kangaroos don’t have sweat glands, they tend to hang out and relax in shaded areas when it’s hot out.<br>
<br>
If they really want to cool down, they will lick their forearms until their fur is soaked.<br>
<br>
They will also lick their paws and rub the moisture on their chest!<br>
<br>
KANGAROOS CAN'T MOVE FORWARD.<br>

Because of how huge and muscular their tail is, kangaroos can’t jump backwards.<br>
<br>
Australia took this as an inspiration for their coat of arms, featuring a kangaroo and an emu.<br>
<br>
Both are animals that can’t move backwards, which symbolizes the nation only moving forward. Inspiring!<br>
<br>
KANGAROOS HAVE A LOT OF DIFFERENT NAMES .<br>
A kangaroo with its baby
Male kangaroos are called boomers, female kangaroos are called flyers, and of course baby kangaroos are joeys.<br>
<br>
If there’s a group of kangaroos, they can be referred to either as a mob, a troop, or a court.<br>
<br>
Since kangaroos are very social animals, they are almost always in a group, sometimes as small as 3 or 4, sometimes as large as 100!<br>
<br>
NEWBORN JOEYS ARE A SIZE OF A LIMA BEAN.<br>
A tiny little adorable joey baby kangaroo
As the gestation period for kangaroos is incredibly short (only 33 days!), joeys are tiny when they emerge.<br>
<br>
They stay in the pouch where they grow for 4 months, at which point they leave the pouch for short periods of time.<br>
<br>
At 10 months is when they finally leave the pouch for good!<br>

 This is a cat and it is there in any zoo no doubt!!!!It looks so cute I loved it!!!!!!!!!
    <h2 class="facts">101 cat facts</h2></p> 
 <p class="story"><br>You may love your cat, but you may not be fully aware of just how cool your she — and her overall species — really is. For example, did you know that cats have an extra organ that allows them to taste scents? Or that they developed meowing as a way to communicate exclusively with humans?<br>
<br>
Clearly, there’s more to your little feline friend than meets the eye. So, to help you fully appreciate how awesome cats are, we asked cat care professionals on Care.com — namely, cat sitters, boarders, and groomers — to share their favorite fun facts about these mystical creatures. We then pulled together a list of the 101 most amusing cat facts that you can share with your friends and family.<br>
<br>
A house cat’s genome is 95.6 percent tiger, and they share many behaviors with their jungle ancestors, says Layla Morgan Wilde, a cat behavior expert and the founder of Cat Wisdom 101. These behaviors include scent marking by scratching, prey play, prey stalking, pouncing, chinning, and urine marking.
Cats are believed to be the only mammals who don’t taste sweetness.<br>
<br>
Cats are nearsighted, but their peripheral vision and night vision are much better than that of humans.<br>
<br>
Cats are supposed to have 18 toes (five toes on each front paw; four toes on each back paw).<br>
<br>
Cats can jump up to six times their length.<br>
<br>
Cats’ claws all curve downward, which means that they can’t climb down trees head-first. Instead, they have to back down the trunk.<br>
<br>
Cats’ collarbones don’t connect to their other bones, as these bones are buried in their shoulder muscles.<br>
<br>
Cats have 230 bones, while humans only have 206.<br>
<br>
Cats have an extra organ that allows them to taste scents on the air, which is why your cat stares at you with her mouth open from time to time.<br>
<br>
Cats have whiskers on the backs of their front legs, as well.<br>
<br>
Cats have nearly twice the amount of neurons in their cerebral cortex as dogs.<br>
<br>
Cats have the largest eyes relative to their head size of any mammal.<br>
<br>
Cats make very little noise when they walk around. The thick, soft pads on their paws allow them to sneak up on their prey — or you!<br>
<br>
Cats’ rough tongues can lick a bone clean of any shred of meat.<br>
<br>
Cats use their long tails to balance themselves when they’re jumping or walking along narrow ledges.<br>
<br>
Cats use their whiskers to “feel” the world around them in an effort to determine which small spaces they can fit into. A cat’s whiskers are generally about the same width as its body. (This is why you should never, EVER cut their whiskers.)<br>
<br>
Cats walk like camels and giraffes: They move both of their right feet first, then move both of their left feet. No other animals walk this way.<br>
<br>
Male cats are more likely to be left-pawed, while female cats are more likely to be right-pawed.<br>
<br>
Though cats can notice the fast movements of their prey, it often seems to them that slow-moving objects are actually stagnant.<br>
<br>
Some cats are ambidextrous, but 40 percent are either left- or right-pawed.<br>
<br>
Some cats can swim.<br>
<br>
There are cats who have more than 18 toes. These extra-digit felines are referred to as being “polydactyl.”<br>
<br>
Facts about cat health & wellness<br>
<br>
A cat’s average lifespan increased by a year over the span of time between 2002 and 2012, according to a study by Banfield Pet Hospital.<br>
<br>
According to The Huffington Post, cats typically sleep for 12 to 16 hours a day.<br>
<br>
Cats are crepuscular, which means that they’re most active at dawn and dusk.<br>
<br>
Cats are fastidious creatures about their “bathroom.” If you have more than one cat, you should have one litter box for each.<br>
<br>
Cats can spend up to a third of their waking hours grooming.<br>
<br>
Cats live longer when they stay indoors.<br>
<br>
Cats’ purring may be a self-soothing behavior, since they make this noise when they’re ill or distressed, as well as when they’re happy.<br>
<br>
Cats will refuse an unpalatable food to the point of starvation.<br>
<br>
Despite popular belief, many cats are actually lactose intolerant.<br>
<br>
Female cats have the ability to get pregnant when they are only 4 months old!<br>
<br>
Grapes and raisins, as well as onions, garlic, and chives, are all extremely harmful foods for cats. Grapes and raisins can cause kidney failure — although the reasoning behind that isn’t clear. Meanwhile, onions, garlic, and chives wreak havoc on your cat’s gastrointestinal system and can cause anemia.<br>
<br>
If you keep your cat active during the day, he will sleep better at night. If you’re not free-feeding your cat, you can also help her get a good night’s sleep by providing her with a substantial evening meal.<br>
<br>
It’s believed that catnip produces an effect similar to LSD or marijuana in cats. The effects of nepetalactone — the chemical in catnip that can makes cats crazy — wears off within 15 minutes, and won’t surface again for a few hours, even if your cat remains in sniffing distance.<br>
<br>
Kittens can be spayed or neutered when they are only eight weeks old. If possible, these procedures should be performed in the first 5 months of your cat’s life.<br>
<br>
Male cats who have been fixed need fewer calories to maintain their weight.<br>
<br>
Spaying and neutering can extend a cat’s life. The Banfield Pet Hospital study found that neutered males live an average of 62 percent longer than unneutered cats and spayed females live an average of 39 percent longer than unspayed cats.<br>
<br>
Your cat’s grooming process stimulates blood flow to his skin, regulates his body temperature and helps him relax.<br>
<br>
Facts about cat communication cues<br>
<br>
A cat with a question-mark-shaped tail is asking, “Want to play?”
According to Wilde, a slow blink is a “kitty kiss.” This movement shows contentment and trust.<br>
<br>
Cats have a unique “vocabulary” with their owner — each cat has a different set of vocalizations, purrs and behaviors.<br>
<br>
Cats have up to 100 different vocalizations — dogs only have 10.<br>
<br>
Cats find it threatening when you make direct eye contact with them.<br>
<br>
Cats mark you as their territory<br>
<br>

when they rub their faces and bodies against you, as they have scent glands in those areas.<br>
<br>
Cats may yawn as a way to end a confrontation with another animal. Think of it as their “talk to the hand” gesture.<br>
<br>
Hissing is defensive, not aggressive, says Wilde. “It’s an expression of fear, stress or discomfort of a threatened cat communicating ‘stay away,'” she says.<br>
<br>
If cats are fighting, the cat that’s hissing is the more vulnerable one, says Wilde.<br>
<br>
If your cat approaches you with a straight, almost vibrating tail, this means that she is extremely happy to see you.<br>
<br>
Kneading — which some people refer to as “making biscuits” — is a sign of contentment and happiness. Cats knead their mothers when they are nursing to stimulate the let-down of milk.<br>
<br>
Meowing is a behavior that cats developed exclusively to communicate with people.<br>
<br>
When a cat flops over and exposes his belly, it’s not always an invitation for a belly rub. A cat does this when he’s relaxed and showing trust.<br>
<br>
When cats hit you with retracted claws, they’re playing, not attacking.<br>
<br>
When dogs wag their tails, they may be expressing happiness. But this isn’t the case for cats! When your cat wags her tail, it’s her way of warning you that you are getting on her last nerve.<br>
<br>
When your cat sticks his butt in your face, he is doing so as a gesture of friendship.<br>
<br>
Whiskers are also good indicators of a cat’s mood. When a cat is scared, he put his whiskers back. But when a cat is in hunting mode, he puts his whiskers forward.<br>
<br>
Your cat drapes its tail over another cat, your dog, or you as a symbol of friendship.<br>
Facts about quirky cat behaviors<br>
<br>
Cats are very fussy about their water bowls; some prefer to ignore their bowls entirely in favor of drinking from the sink faucet.<br>
<br>
Cats groom other cats — and sometimes people — in a ritual called allogrooming.<br>
<br>
Cats like to sleep on things that smell like their owners, such as their pillows and dirty laundry (ick!).<br>
<br>
Cats love to sleep in laundry baskets, too, because they’re basically hiding places with peep holes.<br>
<br>
Cats often attack your ankles when they’re bored.<br>
<br>
Certain cats go crazy for foods you wouldn’t expect, like olives, potato chips, and the hops in beer.<br>
<br>
For some reason, cats really dislike citrus scents.<br>
<br>
If you can’t find your cat, you should look in a box or a bag, as these are some of their favorite hiding spots!<br>
<br>
Male cats who try to get to a female in heat can show very bizarre behavior — for example, some have been known to slide down chimneys!<br>
<br>
Many cats like to lick their owner’s freshly washed hair.<br>
<br>
Some cats love the smell of chlorine.<br>
<br>
Thieving behavior is not uncommon among cats. They will often grab objects like stuffed animals, feather dusters, and other things that remind them of prey.<br>
<br>
Facts about cats who made history<br>
<br>
A green cat was born in Denmark in 1995. Some people believe that high levels of copper in the water pipes nearby may have given his fur a verdigris effect.<br>
<br>
It turns out that Abraham Lincoln was a crazy cat president! He had four cats that lived in the White House with him.<br>
<br>
Maria Assunta left her cat, Tomasso, her entire $13 million fortune when she died in 2011.<br>
<br>
President Bill Clinton’s cat, Socks, was a media darling during the Clinton administration and was said to receive more letters than the President himself.<br>
<br>
Stubbs, a 17-year-old orange tabby, is mayor of the historic district of Talkeetna, Alaska.<br>
<br>
Other surprising cat facts you didn’t know<br>
<br>
A cat’s learning style is about the same as a 2- to 3-year-old child.<br>
<br>
A cat’s purr vibrates at a frequency of 25 to 150 hertz, which is the same frequency at which muscles and bones repair themselves.<br>
<br>
A group of kittens is called a “kindle.”<br>
<br>
A house cat could beat superstar runner Usain Bolt in the 200 meter dash.<br>
<br>
About half of the cats in the world respond to the scent of catnip.<br>
<br>
Cat breeders are called “catteries.”<br>
<br>
Cats can be toilet-trained.<br>
<br>
Cats can drink sea water in order to survive. (In case you’re wondering, we can’t.)<br>
<br>
Cats don’t have an incest taboo, so they may choose to mate with their brothers and sisters.<br>
<br>
Cats dream, just like people do.<br>
<br>
Cats have contributed to the extinction of 33 different species.<br>
<br>
Cats perceive people as big, hairless cats, says Wilde.<br>
<br>
Cats were first brought to the Americas in colonial times to get rid of rodents.<br>
<br>
Collective nouns for adult cats include “clowder,” “clutter,” “glaring,” and “pounce.”<br>

Each cat’s nose print is unique, much like human fingerprints.
Every Scottish Fold cat in the world can trace its heritage back to the first one, which was found in Scotland in the 1960s, says Cheryl Hogan, a Scottish Fold breeder and the committee chair for the breed at The International Cat Association (TICA).<br>
<br>
It’s not uncommon to see cats in food stores in big cities as a form of free — and adorable — pest control.<br>
<br>
Kittens in the same litter can have more than one father. This is because the female cat releases multiple eggs over the course of a few days when she is in heat.<br>
<br>
Male cats are the most sensitive to catnip, while kittens under 3 months old have no response at all.<br>
<br>
Most world languages have a similar word to describe the “meow” sound.<br>
<br>
People often think that they’ve stumbled over a purebred as a stray or in a shelter, but Hogan says that this is very uncommon. “Ninety-nine times out of 100 what you have found on the street will not be purebred anything,” she says. “Very seldom do breeders sell kittens that are not already spayed or neutered,” as purebred cats need to meet very strict standards.<br>
<br>
Some 700 million feral cats live in the United States, and many shelters run trap-neuter-release programs to stem the population growth.<br>
<br>
Studies suggest that domesticated cats first appeared around 3600 B.C.<br>
<br>
The first known cat video was recorded in 1894.<br>
<br>
There are about 88 million pet cats in the United States, which makes them the most popular pet in the country!<br>

<br>
White cats with blue eyes are prone to deafness.<br>
